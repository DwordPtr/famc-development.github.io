        <h3>Bundles</h3>

        <h4>Bundle Structure</h4>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>/Command</strong> - Symfony command-line tasks<br></li>
          <li><strong>/Component</strong> - Generally used for Interfaces, and abstract classes which services can extended/inherited; Generic Traits; It should contain subfolders<br></li>
          <li><strong>/Controller</strong>* – Controllers should have a small amount of actions and the actions themselves should not be large<br></li>
          <li><strong>/DBAL/Types</strong> - Custom DBAL Types<br></li>
          <li><strong>/DependencyInjection</strong>* – It consists primarily of the bundle configuration, occasionally CompilerPass.<br></li>
          <li><strong>/Document</strong> – model classes managed by the ODM and their repositories.<br></li>
          <li><strong>/Entity</strong> – model classes managed by an ORM model and their repositories.<br></li>
          <li><strong>/Event</strong> – event classes.<br></li>
          <li><strong>/EventListener</strong> – Listeners / Subscribers. It can contain subfolders, e.g. for Doctrine or Form listeners, etc. You would usually see a reversed directory structure. In other libraries Form/EventListener is more common than EventListener/Form. I’d recommend the latter in order to avoid spreading the EventListener directory within a single bundle. This also goes hand in hand with the guidelines, which refer to a small amount of directories and their generic nature.<br></li>
          <li><strong>/Form</strong> – form related class. It contains subfolders, in particular Form/Type and Form/DataTransformer.<br></li>
          <li><strong>/Model</strong> – model classes that are not managed by ORM/ODM.<br></li>
          <li><strong>/Resources</strong>* – bundle specific resources e.g. translations, documentation, service config<br></li>
          <li><strong>/Service</strong> – Service classes which are domain specific to the bundle which are not listeners and do not match other folders. It may contain subfolders.<br></li>
          <li><strong>/Tests</strong> – The folder structure corresponds to the structure of the folders in the bundle, so if you want to test a class located in the Service/MyService.php, put the test case in the file Tests/Service/MyServiceTest.php.<br></li>
          <li><strong>/Twig/Extensions</strong> – Classes that are extensions for Twig. It is placed here mainly as an example of the 2nd case in step 3 of the guidelines.<br></li>
          <li><strong>/Validator</strong> – validators.<br></li>
          <li><strong>Events.php</strong> – final class containing constants with the names of the events defined in the bundle.<br></li>
        </ul>

        <p>* - Standard symfony folder </p>

        <h4>Documentation</h4>

        <p>Each bundle should contain a <strong>Resources/doc</strong> folder. In that folder should,
          at minimum include a README file with a description of the bundle - the more
          detailed the better.  Documentation should be written in
          <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">markdown</a>. </p>

        <h5>Boilerplate README.md</h5>

<pre><code>
  # Bundle Name

  ## Description (or Purpose)

  ## Services

  ## Notes
</code></pre>

        <h3>Doctrine</h3>

        <h4>Flush</h4>

        <p>The flush method should only be executed from a Controller or a Command [-line task].</p>

        <h3>Entity</h3>

        <p>Entity should be ProudCamelCased while members on entities should be
          headLessCamelCased. Every entity should have a populated Table Annotation with
          the table name defined. Table names should be all lower case and singular.
          Spaces should be replaced by an underscore.<br>
          Example: </p>

<pre><code>/**
  * @ORM\Entity
  * @ORM\Table(&quot;application_group&quot;)
  */
  class ApplicationGroup {

  /**
  * @var string $createdBy
  *
  * @ORM\Column(name=&quot;created_by&quot;, type=&quot;string&quot;, length=255)
  */
  private $createdBy;

  ...
  }
</code></pre>

        <h3>Routing</h3>

        <h4>Controllers</h4>

        <p>Controllers should be organized by a common element with a class level Route
          annotation with a defined slug referencing the common element. Each action
          would then have a user-friendly slug. For example, a Product, CRUD (Create,
          Read, Update, Delete) operations should fall under a ProductController where
          all actions will start with /product. Actions would be &quot;/&quot; for an index or
          &quot;/edit/{slug}&quot; for the edit action.</p>

        <h4>Names</h4>

        <p>Route names for individual actions should follow, where allowable, the
          convention of &quot;subject<em>verb.&quot; In the example above, the name of the edit
            product action would be &quot;product</em>edit&quot; and the index would be &quot;product_index.&quot;</p>

        <h3>Service</h3>

        <p>The service should not include the word Service suffixed to the class name.
          Within the service container, the service should include the vender and the
          bundle in the name. Services categorized into a subfolder/namespace should also
          include the subfolder/namespace.</p>

<pre><code>class: FAMC\CiDeployment\ConductorBundle\Service\Deployment
  service: famc.conductor.deployment

  class: FAMC\CiDeployment\ConductorBundle\Service\Git\Stash
  service: famc.conductor.git.stash
</code></pre>

        <p>Service arguments and method calls should be listed on individual lines to ease
          readablility and modification.</p>

<pre><code>class: FAMC\CiDeployment\ConductorBundle\Service\Deployment
  service: famc.conductor.deployment
  arguments:
  - &#39;@famc.conductor.stash&#39;
  - &#39;@famc.jenkins.spinup.project&#39;
  calls:
  - [ setContainer, [ &quot;@service_container&quot; ]]
  - [ setTimeout, [ &quot;%famc.conductor.deployment.timeout%&quot; ]]
</code></pre>

        <h4>Utility Classes</h4>

        <p>Utility classes are simply singleton service classes. They have static methods
          and are &quot;dumb.&quot; Utility class names should end in &quot;Util.&quot; They require no
          instantiation and generally perform simple tasks much like data transformation
          that is reusable. An example might be an array reduction. You would see them
          called like so:  </p>

<pre><code>$gridData = PricingGridUtil::reduceDataSet($fullPricingGridData);
</code></pre>

        <h3>Traits</h3>

        <p>Trait files should live in places where it makes sense for them to be. If a
          trait is used for multiple services then the trait should live in the
          <strong>Service</strong> folder, if it is used exclusively by an entity then it should reside
          in the <strong>Entity</strong> folder. Generic or does not belong to a specific type of class
          then the traits should be housed in the <strong>Component</strong> folder.</p>
